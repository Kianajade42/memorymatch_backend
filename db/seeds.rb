# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# User.create(username: "KJL")
# User.create(username: "Kiana")
# User.create(username: "K2")

# Game.create(user_id: 1, score: 23, time: 67)
# Game.create(user_id: 2, score: 14, time: 45)
# Game.create(user_id: 3, score: 19, time: 84)
